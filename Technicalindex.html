          <p>Jabulane is people's person he always find a way to make everyone him feel at easy and confident because he always find a way to adapt without offending or looking down to others.
            He is a hard working individual who is always focused and enjoys to work with groups and individually, he also knows well that two heads are better one and one of the best routes to progress is objective accomplishment for better self-management.
            He is currently in his last year as an undergraduate in BSc Information technology under the VAAL campus.
            He takes his inspiration from those who work hard to show others that failure and disappointment are not obstacles in achieving any goal but those are motivations, meaning putting effort into anything you do regardless of outcomes you may get enables you to always know that you are one step ahead to success.
